A computer science major, studying at the University of Houston, who is very interested in getting his foothold in the field of Data & Analytics. 

Whether it be creating dashboards/reports from existing data, maintaining a data warehouse or lakehouse, or experimenting with various machine learning models, I'm always interested in learning something new for my career every day.
